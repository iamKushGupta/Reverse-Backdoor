# Reverse-Backdoor
The given Python code is for a Reverse-Backdoor, that grants a User, Remote Code Execution access to a target computer.


A Reverse TCP opens a backdoor on the victim system which is remotely operated by the attacker without the victim's knowledge. The firewall, in this particular OS version, only scans the incoming traffic and doesn't examine the outgoing traffic which is the flaw that leads to the back door connection.

The uploaded code has been optimised for a Windows operating system, but cna be used, with a little bit of tinkering on any OS, like MacOS, Linux, Android, etc.
